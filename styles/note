This sytem is currently no backend since the system uses LocalStorage for data persistence. However, there are limitations:

Current Limitations (uses LocalStorage only):
-  Data is stored only is the user's browser
- No data sharing between different browsers/devices
limited storage capacity (5-10mb)
- No server-side validation or sercurity
- No backup or recovery options
-No multi-user support

Backend if needed:
- Multiple users need to access same data
- Data backup and recovery is important
- Large datasets exceeding localStorage limits
Security requirements for sensitive applicant data
Integration with other systems/databases
- Advanced features like user authentication, reporting etc.

Backend Options:
- PHP + MySQL - Traditional web stack
- Node.js + MongoDB - JavaScript full-stack
- Python (Django/Flask) + PostgreSQL - Robust and scalable
- Firebase - Quick setup, real-time database

Problems/requirements
- Registration Date button filter: when I input a year or a month it should only filter on what was input year or month and when at the application was marked as N/A dont show it same as at the brgy. when I input for example a maimpis it will filter only the applicants that has inputed maimpis at the brgy. when it it N/A it should not show.

- at the program report it is corect but add a dropdown or any like thaht where in when I click the college grad it will show the courses counts for example there is a total of 10 college grads I will click a button there and it will show that there is 1 IT, 4 BUsinessadd, 3 Educ english major and 2 Cpe

- the header at the applicant table were not good, it is messier when scrolled down becuse the sub header were collpasing 

- when adding a new aplicant the fields should be fill up all and N/A if it is really not applicable




How This Works:
Smart Field Matching: The system tries multiple possible labels for each field
Flexible Matching: It tries exact matches first, then partial matches
Data Normalization: Converts dates, booleans, and empty values to consistent formats
Automatic Field Mapping: Even if your Excel columns are named differently, they'll be matched to the correct fields

Benefits:
✅ No need for exact column names

✅ Handles common variations and abbreviations

✅ Works with different date formats

✅ Normalizes boolean values (Yes/No, True/False, 1/0)

✅ Provides feedback on what was matched

Now your import system will be much more flexible and should work with various Excel file formats without requiring exact column naming!
