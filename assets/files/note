This sytem is currently no backend since the system uses LocalStorage for data persistence. However, there are limitations:

Current Limitations (uses LocalStorage only):
-  Data is stored only is the user's browser
- No data sharing between different browsers/devices
limited storage capacity (5-10mb)
- No server-side validation or sercurity
- No backup or recovery options
-No multi-user support

Backend if needed:
- Multiple users need to access same data
- Data backup and recovery is important
- Large datasets exceeding localStorage limits
Security requirements for sensitive applicant data
Integration with other systems/databases
- Advanced features like user authentication, reporting etc.

Backend Options:
- PHP + MySQL - Traditional web stack
- Node.js + MongoDB - JavaScript full-stack
- Python (Django/Flask) + PostgreSQL - Robust and scalable
- Firebase - Quick setup, real-time database
