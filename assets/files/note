This sytem is currently no backend since the system uses LocalStorage for data persistence. However, there are limitations:

Current Limitations (uses LocalStorage only):
-  Data is stored only is the user's browser
- No data sharing between different browsers/devices
limited storage capacity (5-10mb)
- No server-side validation or sercurity
- No backup or recovery options
-No multi-user support

Backend if needed:
- Multiple users need to access same data
- Data backup and recovery is important
- Large datasets exceeding localStorage limits
Security requirements for sensitive applicant data
Integration with other systems/databases
- Advanced features like user authentication, reporting etc.

Backend Options:
- PHP + MySQL - Traditional web stack
- Node.js + MongoDB - JavaScript full-stack
- Python (Django/Flask) + PostgreSQL - Robust and scalable
- Firebase - Quick setup, real-time database

can you help me fix or solve the preoblem on matching a dyuplicate data

where in it should be like this
there are 2 applicants that has the same name
example:
applicant 1
Name: Maria Dizon Rosario Sr. 
Bday: 11/29/2002

adding
applicant 2
Name: Maria Dizon Rosario Sr. (should chck the first, last, middle and even the suffix)
Bday: 01/01/2003

so a prmpt will show then that there a re match showing the exixstig and the new
it will compare the name and the bday
